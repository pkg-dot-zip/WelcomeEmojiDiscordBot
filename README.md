## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>
**WelcomeEmojiDiscordBot** is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot for welcoming users by reacting to it with an emoji, programmed in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) using [Kord](https://github.com/kordlib/kord). I created this because one of my friends needed it. The bot itself is quite simple; everything was setup and running in an hour. 

You need to run this bot yourself, since I don't host it anywhere. Fortunately, this is a very simple task.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
What things you need to install the software. If you are a developer already you probably have these components installed.

- An IDE for Kotlin development. I used IntelliJ Ultimate Edition _(2023.3.2)_, and recommend you use [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/?section=windows) as well.
- Java installed. This project targets version 19 on the JVM.

### Installing
A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running.

1. Enable the developer mode for you account in your Discord application (this can also be done on mobile). 
2. Go to the [developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
3. Create a new application. Make sure to name the bot appropriately.
4. Navigate to the ‚ÄúBot‚Äù tab to configure it.
5. Create a ".env" file in the top of the project directory.
6. Put variables for _TEST_SERVER_ & _TOKEN_. _TEST_SERVER_ being your server's ID & _TOKEN_ being your bot's token from your developer portal. If this step confuses you check out [this](https://github.com/Kord-Extensions/template) page.
7. Change the *val EMOJI* in *App.kt*.
8. Run the project.

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>
